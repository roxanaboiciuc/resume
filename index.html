          <h2 class="header-title" style="text-align:center">Passionate about data & tech | Self-taught | Photography enthusiast </h2>
            <p>Welcome to my online resume! I have decided to create my resume in such way as I am passionate about back end web development as well as front end.
            Both in my professional and personal projects I am a devoted, curious person and want to learn more each day. I am interested in automation and delivering performance with minumum efforts. I strive for
            organization and documenting every task.
            Besides having a passion for technology and data, I also like photography and have made a blog where I showcase my work with photography as well.</p>

        <p>Here you can see some of my projects in both of my areas of interest.</p>

        <section>
          <h3>Technology</h3>
          <p><b>Project 1 - VBA tool:</b> Working at Procter&Gamle enbled my desire to simplify the work I was doing and hence I helped the development of a VBA tool that would connect to our main 4 SAP instances and
            export reports from each of them. All of the reports would then be taken through some filters and modifications and then we could share them to the team. This tool saved the work time from 3 hours to under 5 minutes.</p>
          <p><b>Project 2 - Python tool:</b> Managing the PowerSteering platform at Tenneco has its challenges and therefore I have come up with an idea to create a Python tool and have it merge multiple excel files
          -than contain employees that left the company - and then compare it with another file with the full list of active users in PowerSteering.</p>
          <p><b>Project 3 - Price tool:</b> Worked together with my manager to design a tool where you can check the price of a product. For this I created a Python tool to consolidate a few excel files from the Purchasing team which act as a database in excel. In the main excel you then have 3 screens, where you can check products in different scenarios. </p>
          <p><b>Project 4 - E-book library - <i>Work in progress</i>:</b> In a pursuit of learning more about web development I am creating an e-book library at the following link:<a href="https://roxanaboiciuc.github.io/E-Book-Library/">E-book Library</a> </p>

          <h3>Photography</h3>
          <p>On my blog I like to show some of the things that go in backstage of the photoshoots I have, what gear do I use and ultimately
            show the pictures resulted. My focus right now is nature, architecture and self portraits, but my plans for the future include having more photoshoots with people. </p>
